Perimeter Network Access Management Policy (Last Updated April 2025) Purpose Our Perimeter Network Access Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for effectively filtering and monitoring network traffic entering and exiting our organization's network boundaries. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for implementing boundary filtering technologies, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and secure web gateways, to enforce network security controls, protect against unauthorized access, and mitigate the risk of external threats. By implementing robust boundary filtering practices, this policy seeks to minimize the risk of malicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and data exfiltration. By configuring appropriate filtering rules, continuous monitoring, and regular updates, we strive to ensure our network resources' confidentiality, integrity, and availability, safeguard sensitive information, and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. By prioritizing boundary filtering, we strengthen our overall cybersecurity posture, enhance network resilience, and maintain the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.  Scope The Perimeter Network Access Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, and stakeholders. It encompasses implementing and managing boundary filtering mechanisms to protect our network from unauthorized access and malicious activities. This policy covers all network boundaries, including external connections such as internet access points, virtual private networks (VPNs), and remote access services. It sets forth guidelines for configuring and maintaining boundary filtering technologies, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and network access control (NAC) solutions. The policy defines procedures for monitoring and filtering network traffic at the boundaries to enforce security policies, prevent unauthorized access, and detect and block malicious activities. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for boundary filtering and cybersecurity governance.",https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/perimeter-network-access-management-policy/,"Perimeter Network Access Management Policy (Last Updated April 2025) Purpose Our Perimeter Network Access Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for effectively filtering and monitoring network traffic entering and exiting our organization's network boundaries.

Software applications running on <Company Name>'s networks may require access to one of the many internal database servers. In order to access these databases, a program must authenticate to the database by presenting acceptable credentials.  If the credentials are improperly stored, the credentials may be compromised leading to a compromise of the database.  Scope This policy is directed at all system implementer and/or software engineers who may be coding applications that will access a production database server on the <Company Name> Network. This policy applies to all software (programs, modules, libraries or APIS that will access a <Company Name>, multi-user production database.  It is recommended that similar requirements be in place for non-production servers and lap environments since they don’t always use sanitized information.  Safeguards General  In order to maintain the security of <Company Name>'s internal databases, access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the program's source code in clear text or easily reversible encryption. Database credentials must not be stored in a location that can be accessed through a web server.

Safeguards General  In order to maintain the security of <Company Name>'s internal databases, access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the program's source code in clear text or easily reversible encryption. Database credentials must not be stored in a location that can be accessed through a web server. Algorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST publication FIPS 140-2 or any superseding document, according to date of implementation. The use of the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms is strongly recommended for asymmetric encryption."

Specific Requirements Storage of Data Base Usernames and Passwords  • Database usernames and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing body of the program's code. This file must not be world readable or writeable. • Database credentials may reside on the database server. In this case, a hash function number identifying the credentials may be stored in the executing body of the program's code.  • Database credentials may be stored as part of an authentication server (i.e., an entitlement directory), such as an LDAP server used for user authentication. Database authentication may occur on behalf of a program as part of the user authentication process at the authentication server. In this case, there is no need for programmatic use of database credentials.  • Database credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web server.  • Passwords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to the Password Policy.   Retrieval of Database User Names and Passwords If stored in a file that is not source code, then database user names and passwords must be read from the file immediately prior to use. Immediately following database authentication, the memory containing the user name and password must be released or cleared.   The scope into which you may store database credentials must be physically separated from the other areas of your code, e.g., the credentials must be in a separate source file. The file that contains the credentials must contain no other code but the credentials (i.e., the user name and password) and any functions, routines, or methods that will be used to access the credentials.   For languages that execute from source code, the credentials' source file must not reside in the same browsable or executable file directory tree in which the executing body of code resides.",https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/database-credentials-standard/,"Specific Requirements Storage of Data Base Usernames and Passwords  • Database usernames and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing body of the program's code.

Physical Security Management Policy (Last Updated April 2025) Purpose Our Physical Security Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for protecting the physical assets, facilities, and infrastructure that house our organization's critical systems, data, and networks. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for implementing robust physical security measures, including access controls, surveillance systems, and incident response protocols, to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption to our physical assets. By implementing effective physical security practices, this policy seeks to safeguard our information assets' confidentiality, integrity, and availability, minimize the potential impact of physical security incidents, and ensure the continuous operation of our systems and services. Through integrating physical and cybersecurity controls, we strive to create a secure and resilient environment that protects against both digital and physical threats while maintaining the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.  Scope The Physical Security Policy applies to all employees, contractors, visitors, and stakeholders accessing our organization's physical premises, facilities, and assets. This policy encompasses implementing and maintaining measures to protect the physical infrastructure and assets from unauthorized access, theft, damage, and tampering. It covers areas such as building access controls, video surveillance, visitor management, secure storage, disposal of sensitive information, and the protection of server rooms, data centers, and other critical physical locations. The policy sets guidelines for physical security assessments, incident reporting, and response procedures. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for physical security and cybersecurity governance.",https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/physical-security-management-policy/,"Physical Security Management Policy (Last Updated April 2025) Purpose Our Physical Security Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for protecting the physical assets, facilities, and infrastructure that house our organization's critical systems, data, and networks.
