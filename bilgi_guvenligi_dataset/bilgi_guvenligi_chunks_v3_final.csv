Additionally, this policy provides direction to ensure that Federal regulations are followed, and legal authority is granted for the dissemination and use of encryption technologies outside of the United States. Scope This policy applies to all <Company Name> employees and affiliates. Safeguards Algorithm Requirements Ciphers in use must meet or exceed the set defined as ""AES-compatible"" or ""partially AES-compatible"" according to the IETF/IRTF Cipher Catalog, or the set defined for use in the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication FIPS 140-2, or any superseding documents according to the date of implementation. The use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is strongly recommended for symmetric encryption.

SANS_Database_Credentials_Standard_April2025.pdf,https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/database-credentials-standard/,full,0.0,0,"Database Credentials Standard (Last Updated April 2025) Purpose This policy states the requirements for securely storing and retrieving database usernames and passwords (i.e., database credentials) for use by a program that will access a database running on one of <Company Name>'s networks. Software applications running on <Company Name>'s networks may require access to one of the many internal database servers. In order to access these databases, a program must authenticate to the database by presenting acceptable credentials. If the credentials are improperly stored, the credentials may be compromised leading to a compromise of the database. Scope This policy is directed at all system implementer and/or software engineers who may be coding applications that will access a production database server on the <Company Name> Network. This policy applies to all software (programs, modules, libraries or APIS that will access a <Company Name>, multi-user production database. It is recommended that similar requirements be in place for non-production servers and lap environments since they don’t always use sanitized information. Safeguards General In order to maintain the security of <Company Name>'s internal databases, access"

It is recommended that similar requirements be in place for non-production servers and lap environments since they don’t always use sanitized information. Safeguards General In order to maintain the security of <Company Name>'s internal databases, access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the program's source code in clear text or easily reversible encryption. Database credentials must not be stored in a location that can be accessed through a web server. Algorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST publication FIPS 140-2 or any superseding document, according to date of implementation. The use of the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms is strongly recommended for asymmetric encryption. Specific Requirements Storage of Data Base Usernames and Passwords • Database usernames and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing body of the program's code.

Database authentication may occur on behalf of a program as part of the user authentication process at the authentication server. In this case, there is no need for programmatic use of database credentials. • Database credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web server. • Passwords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to the Password Policy.

Immediately following database authentication, the memory containing the user name and password must be released or cleared. The scope into which you may store database credentials must be physically separated from the other areas of your code, e.g., the credentials must be in a separate source file. The file that contains the credentials must contain no other code but the credentials (i.e., the user name and password) and any functions, routines, or methods that will be used to access the credentials. For languages that execute from source code, the credentials' source file must not reside in the same browsable or executable file directory tree in which the executing body of code resides.
